### About the Competition
- **Task:** Predict the outcomes of this year's US women's college basketball tournament (NCAA Div. I). 
- **Eval Metric:** Submissions are scored on the log loss. According to Kaggle, the use of the logarithm provides extreme punishments for being both confident and wrong. Therefore, in the ideal world, you want your predictions to be relativefly aggressive when you nail the outcomes and relatively modest when the upsets occur.
- **Timeline:** Participants were asked to submit their predictions before the first round started. Therefore, all participants must predict all the possible matchups (2,016 in total).
